 Ray tracing course week 03


Class assignment

1. Modify 'find_intersection()' to render a square with various sizes and locations using different 't' and 'Interval'. 
2. Modify 'find_intersection()' to render 3 squares with various sizes and locations.
3. Replace 'get_center_ray()' with 'get_ray()'. See the difference between (2.) and (3.).
4. Generate random rays at the same pixel using 'get_ray()' and 'samples_per_pixel'. The result from 'get_color()' is then accumulated to 'pixel_color' and scaled in 'write_to_film()'. See the difference between (3.) and (4.).
